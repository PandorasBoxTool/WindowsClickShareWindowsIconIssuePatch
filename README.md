Windows ClickShare Windows Icon Issue Patch

Please execute this shell file on the PC in Powershell 
with .\PatchFileThatWillWorking.ps1

The script fixes the following error pattern:
Taskbar without function, 
Windows icon without function, 
Windows calendar without function in the taskbar, 
Right click on icons in the taskbar without function 

The error comes from ClickShare because in the registry important keys are deleted because of Windows Defender Deep Scan win32k.exe
